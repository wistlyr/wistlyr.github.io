# Cafe Rules & Requirements

Cafe is a channel for serious discussion. It is NOT a venting channel. Do not attempt to use it as one.

Staff uphold a high standard for user entry to #cafe. We'll take into account your post history, as well as who you are as a person for your application. Staff have full right to reject your application by vote if we believe you do not meet the basic criteria, or will not be a good fit for #cafe.

**#cafe's rules:**

1) Be civil.
2) Be polite.
3) Don't threaten others.
4) Observe the Netiquette. http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html

*(No, you don't have to read that entire link.)*

These rules are specific to this channel, and the main server rules still apply. Inappropriate behavior is a ban from #cafe and a server warning. At the same time, just because someone disagrees with you does not mean you can flame them.
