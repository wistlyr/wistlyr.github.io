# Bar Rules & Requirements

Bar is a general channel for 18+ users. It is a companion to #cafe, allowing more sensitive topics.

Staff uphold a high standard for user entry to #bar. We'll take into account your post history, as well as who you are as a person for your application. Staff have full right to reject your application by vote if we believe you do not meet the basic criteria, or will not be a good fit for #bar.

__DISCLAIMER:__ #bar may contain NSFW topics, including news not for the faint of heart. If you are not okay with this, do not submit this application. By submitting an application to enter #bar, you agree that we're not responsible for things you see that you don't like, unless it breaks the rules.

**#bar's rules:**

1. You MUST be above the age of 18 to be in this channel. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS. Liars will be permanently banned and reported to Discord.
2. Explicit pornographic content is not allowed here. Videos, GIFs, still images, or links to explicit sexual content, whether real or illustrated, is banned.
3. Shock imagery that is unspoilered or outside of a news context is banned.

These rules are specific to this channel, and the main server rules still apply. Inappropriate behavior is a ban from #bar and a server warning. At the same time, just because someone disagrees with you does not mean you can flame them.
